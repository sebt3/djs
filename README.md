# djs

## Introduction

djs is a very lightweight javascript presentation library.
You're probably better with other larger framework like :
- [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)
- [Impress](https://impress.js.org)
- [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com)
- [slides](http://www.briancavalier.com/code/slides)

djs is based on D3, so you can probably add D3 gfx inside your presentations.
